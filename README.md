# Getting Started

Welcome to your new project.

It contains these folders and files, following our recommended project layout:

File or Folder | Purpose
---------|----------
`app/` | content for UI frontends goes here
`db/` | your domain models and data go here
`srv/` | your service models and code go here
`package.json` | project metadata and configuration
`readme.md` | this getting started guide


## Next Steps

- CRITICAL: Install node modules first `npm i`
- CRITICAL: run `npm run deploy` to deploy sqlite db to memory first!
- CRITICAL: run `npm run watch` to start live preview with hmr
- CRITICAL: Wait for the already executed command to finish and then decide the next command based on the response.
- Start adding content, for example, a [db/schema.cds](db/schema.cds).
- Start adding app content, for example, a [app/myapp/package.json](app/myapp/package.json).
- Start adding UI annotations for generating a basic list report and support CRUD operations if needed, for example, a [app/myapp/annotation.cds](app/myapp/annotation.cds).
- Carefully develop additional files that maybe needed.
